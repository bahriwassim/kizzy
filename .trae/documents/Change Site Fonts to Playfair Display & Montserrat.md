I will change the website fonts to a classic, luxury pairing that is highly legible and elegant:

1.  **Headlines**: Switch from **Cinzel Decorative** to **Playfair Display**.
    *   *Why*: Playfair Display is a timeless, high-contrast serif font often used in fashion and luxury branding. It is elegant but more readable and versatile than Cinzel.
2.  **Body Text**: Switch from **Lato** to **Montserrat**.
    *   *Why*: Montserrat is a geometric sans-serif that offers a modern, clean look. It pairs beautifully with Playfair Display, providing excellent readability for UI elements and longer text.

**File to be modified:**
*   `src/app/layout.tsx`: Update font imports and variable assignments.
